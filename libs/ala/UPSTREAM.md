# ala: the fork of GPUI

ala is GPUI, split out of its upstream repository on 2026-10-05 and owned since. It
is not a patch branch: nothing gets rebased onto upstream, and upstream fixes come in by hand when
we want them. [zebrilus][zebrilus] carries ala as the git subtree `libs/ala` and edits it there;
penna and nidus build on it as a git dependency.

- Forked from: upstream at `933d8d9381`, limited to the gpui crates.
- The 89 commits after that one are the old patch fork's `zz-patches` branch (tip
  `5a00ac89a4`), replayed under new IDs. That fork stays up as an archive and zebrilus's knowledge
  pages cite its commit IDs; the same commits exist here with the same subjects.
- Upstream license: Apache-2.0, retained as `LICENSE-APACHE`. Third-party notices are in `NOTICE`.

## Layout

```
crates/
  ala/            gpui core, with upstream's utility crates as modules: collections, util,
                  sum_tree, scheduler, http_client, refineable
  ala-macros/     ala's macros and the Refineable derive
  ala-platform/   every backend as a module built only for its target: apple (Metal),
                  macos, linux, windows, web, wgpu, ios, android
third_party/
  cosmic-text/    cosmic-text with ala's patches
```

The ios and android backends have no upstream counterpart.

## Pulling a fix from upstream

Export the patch, map its paths and identifiers with the table above, then apply it. A backend's
root file moved down one directory, so a patch to `crates/gpui_wgpu/src/gpui_wgpu.rs` lands in
`crates/ala-platform/src/wgpu.rs`, and `crate::` paths inside a backend become `crate::<x>::`.

```bash
git -C <upstream-checkout> format-patch -1 <sha> --stdout -- crates/gpui crates/gpui_wgpu \
  | sed -e 's#crates/gpui_wgpu/src/#crates/ala-platform/src/wgpu/#g' -e 's#crates/gpui/#crates/ala/#g' \
        -e 's/\bgpui_wgpu::/ala_platform::wgpu::/g' -e 's/\bgpui::/ala::/g' > fix.patch
git am -3 fix.patch
```

From zebrilus, apply the same patch with `git am -3 --directory=libs/ala`. Limit the pathspec to
the crates the fix touches. Never bulk-merge upstream: take what you need, read it, and run the GPU
tests for the renderers it touches.

## What ala adds

`git log` is the authority, and zebrilus's [ala reference][reference] has the long version. The
core five:

1. `RenderImage::into_frames()`: retired frames hand their pixel buffers back to the caller's pool.
2. `WgpuDeviceContext`: `Window::wgpu_device_context()` exposes the wgpu renderer's `Device` and
   `Queue` (plus an `ala::wgpu` re-export) so an app creates GPU resources on ala's own device.
3. The external-texture element: `ala::external_texture(wgpu::Texture)` paints an app-provided
   texture with normal clipping and HiDPI through the repurposed surface pipeline (a dead YCbCr
   stub upstream).
4. The window corner mask: `Window::set_window_corner_mask()` clips everything the window draws
   except drop shadows to a rounded rect, since content masks are rectangular and scrollbars or
   surfaces would escape a client-drawn frame's rounded corners. The wgpu renderer applies it
   through per-frame globals in every fragment shader.
5. Corner shape: `Window::set_default_corner_smoothing()` swaps every quad's circular arc for a
   superellipse (`2.0` circular, `4.0` squircle), and `set_adaptive_corner_fraction()` resolves an
   ordinary radius against the element so one global setting cannot turn a component into a
   pill. Shadows and the corner mask trace the same exponent; a circular mask around a squircle
   frame cuts the frame's own border off over the arc. `CornerRadiusMode::Fixed` bypasses the
   adaptive compression, `Styled::corner_smoothing` overrides only the element's own fill, border
   and shadows, and fully rounded quads stay true circles.

Later additions include terminal glyph render effects, CoreGraphics stroke variants, device-pixel
synthetic bold, BGRA CoreVideo surfaces, `PlatformDisplay::refresh_rate()`, `TestWindow` raw
handles that return `HandleError::Unavailable` instead of panicking, two drag fixes
(pointer-transparent previews, a drag that survives a rejected `can_drop`),
`TextSystem::underline_thickness`, an optional traffic light scale in `TitlebarOptions`,
CSS-correct spread shadows, per-window content zoom (`Window::set_zoom()`), a usable GPU under WSL
(`ALLOW_UNDERLYING_NONCOMPLIANT_ADAPTER` only when `/dev/dxg` exists), `KeystrokeEvent::is_held`,
liquid glass, the iOS UIKit and Android backends, and the wgpu subpixel offset kept in device
pixels.

## Gotchas when changing renderers or pulling upstream work

- GPU-facing structs must stay a multiple of 8 bytes (const-asserted in `scene.rs`), or every draw
  fails wgpu's binding-size check while Metal silently reads at a skew.
- ala ships wgpu 30; upstream still pinned 29 at the split. Upstream wgpu code written against 29 needs
  `color_space: SurfaceColorSpace::Auto` on both `SurfaceConfiguration`s and
  `Queue::present(frame)` instead of `frame.present()`. The `apply_limit_buckets` change only
  compiles against 30.
- Upstream split instance loading into `shaders_storage.wgsl` and `shaders_webgl.wgsl` with
  per-record `load_*` functions. The storage variant reads the WGSL structs directly, but the WebGL
  loaders hard-code word strides and read sequences: every change that widens a scene struct
  (Quad, Shadow, PolychromeSprite, SurfaceParams) must also touch them, and nothing catches a miss
  at compile time. `Quad` must stay a multiple of 16 bytes (44 words) because the WebGL quad
  decoder reads whole texels.
- Upstream perf tracking sits behind the `profiler` feature. Leave it off in production builds for
  its collection overhead, and never turn it on for wasm: it uses native timing and crashes on
  action dispatch there. `set_frame_trace_enabled` became `set_trace_enabled`, and collectors
  yield `FrameEvent::{Draw,Present}` instead of bare `FrameTiming`.

## Checking a change

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features --exclude ala-platform
cargo test -p ala-platform --all-features
```

ala-platform's tests need a GPU, or Mesa lavapipe on Linux
(`VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.json`). In zebrilus, `just libs check ala` runs
the first two, and the third takes `--manifest-path libs/ala/Cargo.toml`.

Each backend compiles for its own target only. From macOS:

- Linux: `cargo check -p ala-platform --all-features --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, with a
  `zig cc -target x86_64-linux-musl` wrapper named `x86_64-linux-musl-gcc` on `PATH` (drop
  cc-rs's `--target=` flag; a `zig c++` twin as `x86_64-linux-musl-g++`),
  `RUST_FONTCONFIG_DLOPEN=1` and `FREETYPE2_NO_PKG_CONFIG=1`.
- Windows: `cargo check -p ala-platform --all-features --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` with
  `RC_x86_64_pc_windows_msvc` set to Homebrew's `llvm-rc`.
- iOS: `cargo clippy -p ala-platform --all-features --target aarch64-apple-ios`.
- Android: point `CC_aarch64_linux_android`, `AR_aarch64_linux_android` and
  `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER` at the NDK's
  `toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/<host>/bin` clang and `llvm-ar`, then
  `cargo clippy -p ala-platform --all-features --target aarch64-linux-android`. Clippy 1.99
  reports `missing_const_for_thread_local` there for `thread_local!`s that are already `const`,
  so ala allows it on Android.
